`abess` (Adaptive BEst Subset Selection) library aims to solve general best subset selection, i.e., 
find a small subset of predictors such that the resulting model is expected to have the highest accuracy. 
The selection for best subset shows great value in scientific researches and practical application. 
For example, clinicians wants to know whether a patient is health or not based on the expression level of a few of important genes.

This library implements a generic algorithm framework to find the optimal solution in an extremely fast way.
This framework now supports the detection of best subset under: 
[linear regression](https://abess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial/LinearRegression.html),
[classification (binary or multi-class)](https://abess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial/logi_and_multiclass.html),
[counting-response modeling](https://abess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial/PoissonRegression.html),
[censored-response modeling](https://abess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial/CoxRegression.html),
[multi-response modeling (multi-tasks learning)](https://abess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial/MultiTaskLearning.html), etc.
It also supports the variants of best subset selection like 
[group best subset selection](https://abess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial/advanced_features.html#Best-group-subset-selection),
[nuisance penalized regression](https://abess.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial/advanced_features.html#Nuisance-Regression),
Especially, the time complexity of (group) best subset selection for linear regression is certifiably polynomial.

## Installation

To install the `abess` R package from CRAN, just run:

``` r
install.packages("abess")
```

Alternative, you can install the newest version of abess from [github](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github(repo = "abess-team/abess", subdir = "R-package")
```

## Runtime Performance

To show the power of abess in computation, we assess its timings of the CPU execution (seconds) on synthetic datasets, and compare to state-of-the-art variable selection methods. The variable selection and estimation results are deferred to [performance](https://abess-team.github.io/abess/articles/v11-power-of-abess.html). All computations are conducted on a Ubuntu platform with Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9940X CPU @ 3.30GHz and 48 RAM. We compare `abess` R package with three widely used R packages: `glmnet`, `ncvreg`, and `L0Learn`. We get the runtime comparison results:

Compared with the other packages, 
`abess` shows competitive computational efficiency, 
and achieves the best computational power when variables have a large correlation.

Conducting the following command in shell can reproduce the above results in R: 

```shell
$ Rscript abess/docs/simulation/R/timings.R
```


## Open source software     

`abess` is a free software and its source code are publicly available in [Github](https://github.com/abess-team/abess). The core framework is programmed in C++.
You can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the [GPL-v3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). We welcome contributions for `abess`, especially stretching `abess` to the other best subset selection problems. 

## What's news?

New features supported by the latest version (0.4.0) in R CRAN:

* Support generalized linear model when the link function is Gamma distribution. 
By setting `family = "gamma"` in `abess` function, users can analyze the dataset with a positive valued and skewed response. 

* Support flexible support size for sequential principal component analysis (PCA), accompanied with several helpful generic function like `plot`. 

* Support user-specified cross validation division for `abess` and `abesspca` function by additional argument `foldid`. 

* Support robust principal component analysis now. A new R function `abessrpca` can access it.

* Improve the R package document by: adding more details and giving more links related to core functions.
