Description: Extremely efficient toolkit for solving the best subset selection problem in linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression, Cox proportional hazard model, multiple-response Gaussian, and multinomial regression. It implements and generalizes algorithms designed in <doi:10.1073/pnas.2014241117> that exploits a novel sequencing-and-splicing technique to guarantee exact support recovery and globally optimal solution in polynomial times.
